# Choir Practice App

A cross-platform mobile and desktop application designed to help choir members practice their vocal parts. Import songs with multiple voice tracks (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass, etc.), mark tricky sections, and practice on-the-go with Android Auto support.

## Features

- **Multi-Track Song Library**: Organize songs with separate audio tracks for each voice part
- **Smart Practice Tools**:
  - Quick 10-second rewind button
  - Mark and save difficult sections while listening
  - Loop sections repeatedly for focused practice
- **Cloud Sync**: Access your songs and practice markers on all your devices
- **Android Auto Support**: Practice safely while commuting with in-car controls
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Android, iOS, and Windows desktop (web-based)

## Technology Stack

- **Flutter**: Cross-platform app development
- **Firebase**: Backend services (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)
- **Native Android**: For Android Auto integration
- **just_audio**: High-quality audio playback
